            Dynamically typed language:<br>
           <h3>
            A language is dynamically-typed if the type of a variable is checked during run time.<br>
           Variables are bound to objects at run-time by means of assignment statements, and it is possible to bind the same variables to objects of different types during the execution of the program.<br>

        <h2>
         Why js is dynamically typed language?<br>
        </h2>
        <h4>
            Js is dynamically typed language because in this the interpreter assigns variables a type at runtime based on the variable's value at the time
